# State Transition with +1 Source and -1 Sink

This file formalizes a result about state transition systems that's useful for Cairo-like
construction where a multiset of states represent an execution.

The initial state will be added once, the final state will be removed once. Otherwise,
for each step of the execution, the source is removed and the destination is added. All these
need to balance out.

The tricky aspect is how to deal with cycles like a snake eating its own tail. The idea is
that we can remove all the cycles and then find a path from the initial state to the final
state.

## Setup

Given:
- `S`: A finite set of states
- `T ⊆ S × S`: A set of allowed transitions
- `R`: A run, represented as a nat-multiset on `T` (for each transition `t ∈ T`,
  `R(t)` counts how many times the transition is used)

## Net Flow

For each state `x`, we can compute the net flow `R#(x)` as:
```
R#(x) = (sum of R(t) for all t = ⟨x, ·⟩) - (sum of R(t) for all t = ⟨·, x⟩)
```

This represents outflow minus inflow for state `x`.

## Main Result

**Proposition**: If `R#(s) = 1`, `R#(d) = -1`, and `R#(x) = 0` for all other states,
then there exists a cycle-free path from `s` to `d` following transitions in `R`.

## Proof Sketch

1. If `R` contains a cycle, we can remove it. The resulting `R'` is smaller and still
   satisfies the net flow conditions.
2. After removing all cycles, we have a DAG structure.
3. The states reachable from `s` form a finite DAG, which must have at least one leaf `l`.
4. Since `l` has incoming edges but no outgoing edges in `R`, we have `R#(l) < 0`.
5. The only state with negative net flow is `d`, so `l = d`.
6. Therefore, `d` is reachable from `s` via a cycle-free path.
